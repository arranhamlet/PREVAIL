\title{Fill Missing Years by Group (Tidyverse)}
\usage{
fill_missing_years_general(df, year_col, value_col)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame with at least a year and value column.}

\item{year_col}{The name of the year column (as a string).}

\item{value_col}{The name of the value column (as a string).}
}
\value{
A tidy data frame with missing years filled for each group.
}
\description{
For each combination of grouping columns (all columns except year_col and value_col),
this function fills in missing consecutive years, setting the value_col to 0,
and replicates the grouping information. One additional year is added after the last.
}
\examples{
df <- tibble::tibble(
  region = c("A", "A", "A", "B", "B"),
  source = c("X", "X", "X", "Y", "Y"),
  year = c(2000, 2005, 2010, 2000, 2010),
  value = c(1, 25, 29, 3, 12)
)
fill_missing_years_by_group(df, year_col = "year", value_col = "value")
