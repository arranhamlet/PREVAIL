\title{Aggregate Age Structure of a Model Output Object}
\usage{
aggregate_age_structure(
  obj,
  age_breaks,
  method = c("sum", "mean", "weighted.mean"),
  weights = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A data frame with at least the columns `dim1` and `value`. Typically model output like vaccination coverage or seeding.}

\item{age_breaks}{A numeric vector of breakpoints defining age bands (e.g. c(0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, Inf)).}

\item{method}{Character. One of `"sum"`, `"mean"`, or `"weighted.mean"`. Controls how values are aggregated within each age band.}

\item{weights}{Optional numeric vector of weights (e.g., population) for `method = "weighted.mean"`. Must match the full set of model ages (e.g., 0:100 or 1:101).}
}
\value{
A data frame with aggregated `dim1` values matching the number of age groups defined by `age_breaks`.
}
\description{
Aggregates a long-format data frame with an age dimension (`dim1`) into custom age groups
based on specified `age_breaks`. Supports sum, mean, or population-weighted.mean aggregation.
