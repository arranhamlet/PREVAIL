\title{Split a Vector into Bins and Sum Each Bin}
\usage{
split_and_sum(vec, n_bins)
}
\arguments{
\item{vec}{A numeric vector to be grouped and summed.}

\item{n_bins}{An integer specifying the number of bins to split the vector into.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length `n_bins` (or fewer if `vec` has fewer elements),
  where each element is the sum of values in a bin.
}
\description{
This function divides a numeric vector into approximately equal-sized groups (bins),
then computes the sum of values within each bin.
